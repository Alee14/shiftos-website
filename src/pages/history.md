title: "ShiftOS: History"
description: ShiftOS started back in November 2013 when Philip Adams wanted to make a game based on Arch Linux. He originally wanted ShiftOS to be a Linux distro based on Arch Linux but then gave up on that idea due to it not being possible, so he started his own VB.NET program called ShiftOS.
